## 🎯 What Is Assignbots?

Assignbots is a platform where educators can build custom AI chatbots tailored to their teaching goals. These bots can for example:

- Answer student questions based on course materials
- Deliver guided learning experiences
- Run interactive quizzes or tutorials
- Provide support outside class hours

Each bot can be fully configured in tone, appearance, knowledge, and behavior — so it fits your unique teaching style and context.

<Info title="Educator-first, not tech-first">
    You don’t need to know programming or prompt engineering. Assignbots is built for real-world classrooms, not labs.

## 🔐 Built on Privacy and Control

We take privacy seriously. Assignbots is developed by **Enchatted PC**, a Greece-based software company with a privacy-first mindset.

- All user data is encrypted and stored securely on AWS
- Bots, projects, and uploaded content are only visible to you
- You can delete your data at any time, with a single click
- Fully compliant with GDPR and CCPA

Our goal is to give educators control — not just over how their bots behave, but over the information they share.

## 🧱 What You Can Build

There’s no limit to what you can create with Assignbots. Some examples:

- **Quizbot**: Test student knowledge with multiple choice, open questions, and feedback
- **Course Assistant**: Answer student FAQs using your syllabus or notes
- **Assignment Helper**: Guide students through assignments with structured prompts
- **Study Companion**: Offer tips, reminders, or explanations before an exam

Each bot lives inside a **Project**, which acts like a folder for grouping bots by topic, course, or class.
