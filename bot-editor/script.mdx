# 🗣️ Script

The **Script** tab lets you predefine a conversation flow or structure for your bot to follow. This is ideal for quizzes, onboarding, guided tutorials, or structured learning activities.

## What you can do
- Create multiple steps or stages in a conversation
- Define user inputs or choices (e.g., multiple choice, open text)
- Provide custom bot responses at each stage

This allows you to build:
- Quizzes
- Interactive lessons
- Decision trees
- Roleplay scenarios

### Example use case
> Step 1: "Ready to test your knowledge? Let's start with an easy question."
>
> Step 2: Multiple choice — "Which of these is a neurotransmitter?"

<Info title="Scripted bots vs. freeform bots">
    Scripted bots follow a path. Freeform bots are more open-ended and driven by AI prompts. You can mix both for flexibility.

Scripts are optional, but they can make learning more interactive and engaging.
