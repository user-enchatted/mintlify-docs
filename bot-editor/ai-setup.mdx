# ðŸ§  AI Setup

The **AI Setup** tab is where you define your botâ€™s core identity and purpose. This helps guide how the bot thinks, responds, and interacts with users.

## Defining your botâ€™s role

In this section, you can write plain English instructions that describe:
- Who the bot is (e.g. a quiz master, research assistant, tutor)
- What it can and cannot do
- How it should behave

For example:
> "You are a psychology tutor that explains key concepts in clear, simple terms. You avoid jargon unless necessary and provide examples from real-life situations."

<Info title="No coding needed">
    Everything is written in natural language. You donâ€™t need to know any code to design complex bot behavior.

A well-written setup will make your bot more helpful, consistent, and aligned with your teaching goals.
