The **Knowledge** tab is where you provide your bot with the resources it needs to respond intelligently to user questions. You can add multiple types of knowledge sources to guide how the bot thinks and answers.

## Add knowledge dynamically
You can add **multiple** entries of the following types using the available buttons:

- **PDFs** â€” Upload course materials, assignments, or readings in PDF format
- **URLs** â€” Link to relevant web pages, articles, or online sources
- **Text** â€” Paste important notes or excerpts directly as plain text

To add a source, click the corresponding **Add PDF**, **Add URL**, or **Add Text** button in the interface. You can add several of each type.
