# 🎙️ Tone

The **Tone** tab allows you to adjust your bot’s personality and communication style. This makes the interaction feel more natural, engaging, and aligned with your audience.

## Choosing a tone
You can choose from predefined tone presets such as:
- Friendly
- Formal
- Professional
- Playful
- Academic

Or, you can write a custom tone instruction. For example:
> "Speak in an encouraging tone, like a coach. Use short, clear sentences and emojis when appropriate."

<Tip title="Match your audience">
    If your students are high schoolers, a friendly or playful tone may work best. For professional training, formal or academic tones are more suitable.
</Tip>

The tone you set here will shape how the bot interacts across all its responses.
