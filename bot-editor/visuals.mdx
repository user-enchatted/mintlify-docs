# ðŸŽ¨ Visuals

The **Visuals** tab lets you personalize how your bot appears when users interact with it.

## Customizing bot identity
You can configure:

- **Bot name**: This is what users see as the name of the bot in the chat.
- **Avatar**: Upload or choose an image that represents your bot.
- **Welcome message**: The first message the bot sends when the chat opens â€” set the tone and invite users in.

### Example welcome message
> "Hi! I'm your learning buddy ðŸ¤“ â€” ready to dive into today's topic? Ask me anything or choose from the options below."
