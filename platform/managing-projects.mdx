To rename a project or bot:
1. Hover over the item name in the sidebar
2. Click the pencil icon ✏️ that appears
3. Type the new name and press **Enter**

## Deleting
To delete a bot or project:
1. Hover over the item in the sidebar
2. Click the trash icon 🗑️
3. Confirm the deletion (this action cannot be undone)

<Warning title="Data Deletion is Permanent">
    Once you delete a bot or project, it is permanently removed from our system. There is no recovery option.
</Warning>

## Saving Changes

To save any edits to your bots or projects, click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the editor panel. Changes will not be applied until you do.

<Tip title="Don't forget to save!">
