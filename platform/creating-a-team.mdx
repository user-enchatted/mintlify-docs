# 👥 Creating a Team

Teams let you collaborate with colleagues by sharing access to bots — either as editors or viewers. Each team has its own isolated workspace.

### 👥 Invite Team Members

Once your team is created:

1. Go to the dropdown > **Team Settings**
2. In the **Add Team Member** section, enter the person’s email
3. Choose a role:
- **Administrator** – full access and settings control
- **Editor** – can view, edit, and build bots
- **Viewer** – read-only access for analytics
4. Click **Add**

An email invitation will be sent. Once accepted, the user will join your team.

### 🗑️ Delete a Team

Only the **Team Owner** can delete a team.

At the bottom of **Team Settings**, click **Delete Team**.

⚠️ This will permanently erase all bots and data under that team. Be sure to back up anything important first.

Use teams to keep workspaces separate across departments, classes, or institutions — while enabling collaboration with full control.
