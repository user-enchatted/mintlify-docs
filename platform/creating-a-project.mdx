# 🗂️ Creating a Project

Projects in Assignbots act as folders or containers that help you organize your bots by course, topic, or theme.

## Creating your first project

1. From the dashboard, click **New Project** in the sidebar
2. Enter a project name — for example: *"Cognitive Psychology"* or *"Intro to Machine Learning"*
3. Click **Create** to save the project

Your new project will appear in the sidebar and be ready to hold any number of bots.

<Tip title="Organize Smart">
    Use clear and consistent naming for your projects. It makes navigation and collaboration easier — especially if you manage multiple subjects or classes.
</Tip>

Projects are completely private and customizable. You can edit or delete them anytime.
