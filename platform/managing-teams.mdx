# 🛠️ Managing Teams

Once a team is created, team owners and administrators can manage its members and settings from the **Team Settings** page.

### 🧾 Update Team Name

To change the team name:

1. Go to the team dropdown and select **Team Settings**
2. Under **Team Name**, update the name field
3. Click **Save**

This helps distinguish between multiple active teams.

### 👥 Manage Members

In the **Add Team Member** section, you can invite more collaborators by email.

When adding someone, choose a role:

- **Administrator**: Full permissions, including adding/removing users and deleting the team
- **Editor**: Can create, update, and manage bots
- **Viewer**: Can only view analytics and published bot content

You can remove or update roles for existing members at any time.

### ✉️ Inviting Members by Email

Invited users will receive an email like this:

![Team invite email](../../images/team-invite-email.png)

They can:
- Create an account if they don’t already have one
- Accept the invitation and join your team workspace

---

<Info title="Isolated Workspaces">
    Each team workspace is completely separate. Members only see bots and conversations within the teams they’ve joined.
</Info>

---

### 🗑️ Deleting a Team

If you're the **Team Owner**, you can delete the team entirely from **Team Settings**.

This will remove:
- All bots associated with the team
- All members’ access
- All conversation analytics and stored data

⚠️ This action is irreversible.

With teams, you can scale your bot-building workflows across departments, teachers, or research groups — while keeping everything organized and secure.
