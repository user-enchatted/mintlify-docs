# 🤖 Creating a Bot

There are two ways to create a bot in Assignbots — from scratch or using a ready-made template.

---

### ➕ Starting a New Bot

From the **Dashboard**, click **New Assignbot** to open creation options:

- **From Scratch**: Start fresh and fully customize your bot.
- **From Template**: Choose from prebuilt bots designed for education, like:
- **Project-Building Assistant**
- **Professional Learning Designer**
- **Content Generator**

Selecting a template will prefill your bot with role, tone, and visual presets you can modify.

### ✏️ Naming Your Bot

You’ll be prompted to name your bot. Give it something relevant — like *Research Helper* or *Ethics Quiz Bot*.

> Tip: You can rename the bot later by clicking its title in the top dashboard breadcrumb.

---

### 🎯 What Happens Next?

After naming your bot, you’ll land in the **Bot Editor**, where you can:

- Set up the bot’s purpose and tone
- Add custom knowledge and activity scripts
- Customize appearance and messages

We’ll cover all of that in the [Bot Editor section](../bot-editor/ai-setup.mdx).
