# ðŸ“„ How to Duplicate a Bot for Another Project

Duplicating a bot allows you to reuse its structure, tone, knowledge, and behavior across different projects â€” saving time when working with similar materials or class setups.

## Step-by-step

1. Navigate to the project containing the bot you want to duplicate
2. Hover over the bot's name in the sidebar or dashboard
3. Click the **duplicate icon** (or menu > Duplicate, if applicable)
4. Choose the destination project (or create a new one)
5. Rename the new bot if desired
6. Click **Duplicate** to confirm

The duplicated bot will now appear in the selected project with the same settings as the original.
