# ðŸ§ª How to Test Your Bot Before Using It in Class

Before sharing your bot with students, itâ€™s a good idea to test it thoroughly â€” to make sure it behaves the way you expect.

## Step-by-step

1. Open the bot in the **Bot Editor**
2. Review all tabs:
- AI Setup
- Tone
- Visuals
- Knowledge
- Script (if used)
3. Click the **Preview** or **Test** button (usually at the top or bottom of the editor)
4. Interact with the bot as if you were a student:
- Ask questions
- Navigate any scripted flows
- Try different wording or typos to test robustness

## What to look for
- Does the tone match your audience?
- Does the bot reference your uploaded knowledge correctly?
- Are all questions in your script flowing as intended?

<Tip title="Use private testing before sharing">
    Donâ€™t share or embed the bot until youâ€™ve done a full test run â€” especially if using it for graded activities.

Testing helps you catch errors early and ensures your learners have a smooth experience.
