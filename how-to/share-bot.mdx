# ðŸ”— How to Share a Bot with Students

Once your bot is ready, you can share it with students so they can interact with it outside the Assignbots editor.

## Step-by-step

1. Open the project that contains the bot you want to share
2. Click on the bot to enter the editor
3. Look for the **Share** or **Preview** button in the top or side menu
4. Copy the **public share link** provided
5. Share the link with your students via LMS, email, chat, or embed it in your course materials

<Tip title="No login required for students">
    Students donâ€™t need an Assignbots account to use the shared bot â€” the link opens the bot in a clean, interactive interface.
</Tip>

## Embed (if supported)
If embedding is enabled in your version:
- Copy the **embed code** (iframe)
- Paste it into your LMS, website, or digital handout

<Info title="Private by default">
    Bots are private unless explicitly shared. You have full control over which bots are accessible externally.

Sharing bots helps scale engagement and make learning interactive â€” especially for self-paced lessons, homework, or flipped classrooms.
